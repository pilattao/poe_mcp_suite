# Style Template: MINIONS

**What this is:** the layer *above* the archetype library — the shared map of minion builds: recognized
options, common infrastructure, staged acquisitions, and known traps. Use it to *design* a minion build
(pick axes → pick archetype → follow the shared spine → diverge where your playstyle wants), then hand off
to a specific `guides/{archetype}/` entry or `build-design.md` for the character itself.

**Confidence labels** (used throughout, per user preference): ✅ verified (sim/in-game/game-data) ·
◐ community-sourced, unverified · ⛔ dead/wrong — kept deliberately so it isn't re-proposed.

**First instance of the style-template idea (2026-08-04).** Shape is provisional; the playbook gets
written once this has survived a couple of real uses.

---

## 1. Decision axes

Pick one from each row; the combination largely determines the archetype.

| Axis | Options |
|---|---|
| **Persistence** | Permanent army (spectres/zombies/skeletons) · temporary swarm (SRS, Animate Weapon) · triggered/hybrid (Holy Relic, Dom Blow, Chains of Command) · immortal crawler (Herald of Agony) |
| **Damage flavor** | Physical/impale · fire · cold · lightning · **chaos/poison** |
| **Player activity** | Zero-button walker → caster upkeep (SRS) → active self-attacker (Holy Relic, Dom Blow, HoAg) |
| **Defense chassis** | Life+block engine (✅ see §3g) · ES/hybrid · life-regen stacking · "minions are the defense" (Meat Shield walls, turtle windows) |

---

## 2. Archetype roster

### In the library (analyzed — start from these entries)
| Archetype | Flavor / persistence | Entry |
|---|---|---|
| **Poison SRS Necromancer** | chaos-poison, temp swarm | `local library: `poison-srs-necromancer/`` — plus a real character's full history in the maintainer's local character notes |
| **pRAW (Poison Ranged Animate Weapon)** | chaos-poison, temp swarm | `local library: `praw-necromancer/`` — ◐ survey consensus: current S-tier poison-minion pick; setup via **Bladefall of Trarthus** (✅ real, already in our entry) |
| **Holy Relic of Conviction** | phys/holy nova, triggered | `local library: `holy-relic-necromancer/`` — ◐ survey: a **Gladiator** variant (Determined Survivor lucky block) is rising |
| **Turtle spectres** | defensive utility | `local library: `turtle-necromancer/`` — ✅ Guardian Turtle confirmed in the 3.29 spectre roster (`text_lake/spectres.txt`); ⚠ mechanic was hotfixed to ~50% uptime |
| **SRS/Absolution leveling trunk** | shared campaign spine | `local library: `srs-absolution-leveling/`` |
| **Luminary merc summoner** | league-mechanic hybrid | `local library: `luminary-merc-summoner/`` — scope-check league availability |

### Survey-surfaced, NOT yet in the library (◐ — digest a guide before committing)
| Archetype | One-liner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Popcorn SRS** | Minion Instability + Infernal Legion: SRS explode for 33% max life as fire | ◐ "untouched by 3.29 nerfs, reliable starter" |
| **Soulwrest Phantasms** | staff auto-summons phantasms off consumed corpses; CwC Cyclone + Desecrate | ◐ tanky, budget; "Life from Death" cluster sustain |
| **Spectre army** (Frostbearers / Wretched Defilers) | permanent ranged army | ✅ **Congregation Support verified** (Exceptional support, req 72, max lvl 15): **30% → 64% MORE maximum minions** from supported skills — the real deal for any max-count scaling. Spectre choices still ◐ |
| **Chains of Command** | Animate Guardian's weapon spawns animated-weapon copies | ◐ archetype real; ⛔ the claimed "3.29 AG gear-inspection UI" **fails verification** — our league doc's dedicated 3.29 string checks found ZERO Animate Guardian changes; cross-version blending |
| **Dominating Blow / Absolution Guardian** | strike-to-summon sentinels, tanky starter | ◐ |
| **Herald of Agony crawler** | immortal crawler, zero minion management | ◐ survey: niche tank, B-tier; pairs with Cyclone/Ball Lightning virulence stacking |
| **Arakaali's Fang spiders** | on-kill spider swarm, poison | ◐ chase tier with The Squire |
| **Block SRS** (no external guide) | SRS + 66/78 block + auto-triggered offerings | ✅ **live, ours** — the maintainer's live character (local notes); the only fully-verified entry here |

### Directed follow-ups (2026-08-04 — the "absences" resolved; both alive)
| Archetype | Aliases | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Skeleton mages** | "Mage Skelly", "skele mages" | ◐ B-tier mapper, good starter. ⚠ **Freshness catch: Dead Reckoning is NO LONGER the enabler** — the `Summon Skeletons of Mages` transfigured gem does it natively. Variants: Doryani's Prototype lightning; **chaos/poison via conversion gloves** (→ [`minion-fire-to-chaos`](../concepts/minion-fire-to-chaos.md)) |
| **Zoomancer** | "zoo build", "minion army", "walking simulator" | ◐ "Zoo" = **many minion types at once** (70+ active) + zooming mobility. Dominant 3.29 variant: **Chaos Poison Zoomancer** on The Covenant + Ghastly Eyes — the same core our live character runs. Components: Carrion Golem *of the Hordes* (more phys per nearby non-golem — wants a crowd), zombies, Vaal Skeletons on demand, buff spectres (charge-generators), AG with ◐ Asenath's Gentle Touch (curse-explode clear). Creators: GhazzyTV (poe-vault), HelmBreaker (pobarchives) |

| **Golem armies** (Elementalist) | "Golemancer", "golem-stacker" | ◐ Pure minion golems: B-tier chill mapping. The S-tier form is **golems as a BUFF SHELL** — 10+ auto-reviving golems (Liege of the Primordial) scaling the *player's* damage/defence via stacked **Primordial Bond** clusters (◐ ~10% dmg per golem) under Phys-DoT/ignite self-cast builds. Count via Anima Stone, Primordial Chain, Dark Monarch (exclusivity acceptable in a golem-only shell). ⓘ "Minions as player-buffs" is a **tech** — candidate `_concepts/` entry |

---

## 3. Shared infrastructure — what nearly every minion build wants

### 3a. Minion gem levels (✅ the cheapest damage in the game)
Stack `+N to Level of (all) Minion Skill Gems`: wand/sceptre, helmet (+2 tier exists on rares), shield
(+1), Necromancer's **Unnatural Strength** (+2). ✅ Worked example: Raise Spectre 21 gem read 26 effective
(3-spectre breakpoint at gem 25; spectre counts live in the gem's level table, `get_gem_detail`).

### 3b. Darkness Enthroned + Ghastly Eyes (✅)
The belt roughly doubles its 2 socketed Ghastly Eyes (✅ owned copy: 97% increased effect) — belt jewels are
worth ~2× a tree socket. ✅ Poison builds: **poison scales off PHYSICAL and CHAOS damage only** — added
chaos on an eye feeds hit *and* poison; cold/fire/lightning feed only the hit.

### 3c. Offerings + automation (✅ the biggest QoL lever we've found)
Bone (block) / Flesh (speed) / Spirit (regen) Offering, fed by Desecrate. **Automate it**: a wand with the
bench craft *"Trigger a Socketed Spell when you Use a Skill"* fires Desecrate + Offering off your normal
casting. ✅ This single craft enables a 66/78-block chassis with zero extra buttons. Alternative: Mistress
of Sacrifice (offering affects you) if playing that ascendancy node.

### 3d. Defensive supports for permanent minions (✅ in-game verified)
Minions that die constantly usually have **zero defensive supports** — check before buying anything.
✅ Adding Minion Life to zombies+golem stopped repeated wipes outright; spectres/AG want Meat Shield +
Minion Life. ⚠ Minion life/res appear in **no PoB readout** — only in-game observation verifies this.

### 3e. Spectre toolbox by role
Grep the full roster: `rg --no-ignore -i "<tag/skill>" reference_data/text_lake/spectres.txt` (**268**
spectres — tags, skill lists, and a `grants:` column of every player/ally/minion modifier). Roles: damage ·
buffers (◐ "Perfect Spirit of Fortune" utility) · defensive windows (✅ Guardian Turtle). Meat Shield on
defensive spectres makes them taunt/body-block.

### ⚠ Obtainability: most spectres CANNOT be bought (2026-08-09)
Two acquisition classes, and the naming does not tell you which:
- ✅ **Itemized corpses — tradeable.** Only the **`Monsters/LeagueAzmeri`** family (70 tiered entries:
  Imperfect / normal / Perfect). Search the trade site by **`base_type`**, not `name`; poe.ninja doesn't
  list them. These are what "buy a Perfect X" refers to.
- **Everything else — kill it and raise it yourself.** Free, but it means travelling to an area that spawns
  the monster and raising it there (Desecrate + Raise Spectre). Not on trade at any price.
- ⚠ **A "Perfect" prefix does NOT imply tradeable.** `Monsters/FaridunLeague` also carries tiered names
  (e.g. *Perfect Conjuror of Rot*, the only Malevolence source) and returns **0 trade listings** — ◐ either
  untradeable or simply unlisted; treat as "acquire in-game" until proven otherwise.

Consequence for planning: a shopping list and a *hunting* list are different documents. The best spectre for
a build is often free and unbuyable — and, being unmodelled by PoB (below), unsimmable too.

### ⚠ Finding buff spectres takes THREE sweeps — a mod-only sweep misses most of them
A spectre can buff you or your minions through any of three channels, and the text lake surfaces them in
different columns. Sweeping one channel and calling it "the buff spectres" is wrong — it happened here on
2026-08-09 and hid the entire aura roster:

| Channel | Where it lives | Sweep |
|---|---|---|
| Mods | `grants:` | `rg --no-ignore "grants:.*(Player\|Minion\|Ally)Modifier" …/spectres.txt` |
| **Auras** | `skills:` (a skill flagged `SkillType.Aura`) | `python scripts/spectre_aura_sweep.py` — **20 buyable corpse spectres**, incl. every classic aura |
| **Charge/buff skills** | `skills:`, not aura-flagged | grep the skill name: `MassFrenzy` (frenzy charges to allies), `MassPower` (power charges) |

The turtle's Determination, the Forest Tiger's Haste, and the Carnage/Host Chieftains' charge grants are all
invisible to the mod sweep. ⚠ And a fourth channel exists that **no** sweep of PoB can find: game stats PoB
records only as comments (see the Forest Tiger's frenzy grant below) — for those, community sources are the
only signal.

**Aura roster (buyable corpses, from the aura sweep):** Determination (Guardian Turtle) · Discipline
(Judgemental Spirit) · Haste (Forest Tiger) · Pride (Blood Demon) · Hatred (Hydra) · Wrath (Spirit of
Fortune) · Grace (Primal Thunderbird) · Zealotry (Pain Artist) · Precision (Naval Officer) · Vitality
(Warlord) · Clarity (Primal Demiurge) · Purity of Fire/Ice/Lightning (Fiery Cannibal / Frozen Cannibal /
Eldritch Eye) · Smite (Blasphemer). Wild-only: **Malevolence** (Perfect Conjuror of Rot — DoT builds).

**Spectres that buff the player via MODS are rare — only 7 of 268 carry a `PlayerModifier`:**
Guardian Turtle + Perfect Guardian Turtle (3%/5% phys damage reduction), Perfect Druidic Alchemist (**200%
increased flask effect** + life-flask charge generation), Perfect Needle Horror (impale effect), Perfect
Runic Skeleton (5% MORE phys damage), Perfect Slashing Horror (5% phys gained as fire), Perfect Spider
Matriarch (wither effect — ⚠ PoB's own comment says *"Does not work"*). Find them with
`rg --no-ignore "grants:.*PlayerModifier" reference_data/text_lake/spectres.txt`.

⚠ **`grants:` alone under-reports — cross-check the `skills:` column for auras.** The Perfect Guardian
Turtle's biggest gift is *Determination* (✅ measured on a live build: armour 889 → **3,650**, EHP +18.6%),
which lives in its skill list, not its mods; `grants:` catches only its 5% PDR. The Perfect Judgemental
Spirit is the same trap in reverse: `grants:-` (no mods at all), yet its *skills* grant flat fire **and
chaos** damage to `Skeleton`-tagged minions — a large SRS buff, with the chaos feeding poison. It was
written off as "does nothing" twice before correct modeling exposed it (§3e-1).
◐ Its Discipline aura is unresolved: correctly modeled, PoB credits the **player** +529 ES, but the owner's
in-game character sheet read the unbuffed value. In-game beats PoB — assume minion-only until re-checked
with the spectre alive and adjacent.

⚠ **PoB never learns your spectres from an import** (the PoE API doesn't report them), so an unset build
silently simulates *generic* spectres and misses all of the above. Set them with `set_spectres`
(fuzzy names, e.g. `["perfect guardian turtle"]`) — pob-mcp, added 2026-08-09.

### 3e-1. ⚠ PoB models the buffs of only ONE spectre — every multi-spectre build is under-modeled
Root-caused 2026-08-09 in [`CalcPerform.lua:2169`](../../PathOfBuilding/src/Modules/CalcPerform.lua#L2169):
PoB collects `activeSkill.minion.type` for each **Raise Spectre skill instance**, then applies spectre buffs
**only for spectres in that list**. One Raise Spectre gem ⇒ one selected minion ⇒ exactly **one** spectre's
buffs are modeled, no matter how many you have raised. The rest are inert in the calc.

Proof (live build, 3 spectres raised): with the Guardian Turtle selected, armour **3,650** and SRS **51,527**
each. Reordering so a Perfect Hulking Miscreation is selected: SRS jump to **74,014 (+43.6%)** and armour
collapses to **889** — the turtle's Determination silently switched off. Adding a spectre in any non-selected
position changes *nothing at all*, to seven decimal places. **A null result from adding a spectre is
therefore meaningless** — it usually means "not selected", not "no effect". This mimics a broken tag or a
dead mod, and it cost a wrong "the MonsterTag condition doesn't work" conclusion before the position test.

**How to measure spectre X's buff:** list X **first** (`set_spectres(["X", ...])`), measure, restore. Compare
against a run with a *different* spectre first — never against "X absent", or you conflate the buff with the
selected spectre's own damage. Confirm via `minion_dps_breakdown`: the spectre's own contribution shows as
its own row (the Miscreation's was 5,846 = 0.27%), so a jump in the **SRS row** is a genuine buff.

**Modeling more than one — the fix:** the loop reads one minion *per Raise Spectre instance*, so N Raise
Spectre skills pinned to N different spectres model N sets of buffs. The selection is a **per-gem XML
attribute** (`skillMinion` / `skillMinionCalcs`), so it is scriptable even though the GUI dropdown is not:
add an **unassigned**, `includeInFullDPS="false"` group holding one Raise Spectre gem per extra spectre.
Use `scripts/pob_spectre_modeling_group.py`; full procedure in `playbooks/spectre-analysis.md`.
⚠ Unassigned matters — weapon-swap groups are inactive while the main weapon set is live, so spare Raise
Spectre gems parked in a swap slot contribute nothing. ⚠ Every character import calls
`wipeTable(socketGroupList)` and destroys the group — it is a post-import checklist step.

**In game all raised spectres buff simultaneously** — this is a PoB limitation, not a game rule. Measured
on a live 3-spectre build: **1,531,370 Full DPS modeled the default way, 2,502,251 with all three modeled.
PoB was understating the character by 63%.**

### 3e-1b. Two field-confirmed rules (live build, 2026-08-19)
- **“more maximum Minions” rounds DOWN**: Congregation Support L2 (~32% more) supporting Raise Spectre on a
  base cap of 5 → 6.6 → **cap 6**, confirmed by raising the 6th in game. Plan breakpoints accordingly
  (L1–30% needs base 4 to add a spectre; base 5 needs any level; the jump to ×7 needs ~40% → gem ~L5+).
- **An unmodeled spectre makes every PoB number a FLOOR, not wrong** — the fix is bookkeeping, not modeling:
  keep the modeled N-1 correct, record the unmodeled one’s effect qualitatively from the wiki, and label all
  sims as floors. Live example: Spectral Leader (action-speed buff + own SRS swarm) as a 6th spectre.

### 3e-2. How to judge a spectre for a minion build (the reasoning, not the roster)

**The question is never "is this spectre strong?" — it is "does what it grants land on what my build
scales?"** Four mod destinations, and only two usually matter to a minion build:

| Grant type | Lands on | Worth to a minion build |
|---|---|---|
| the spectre's own stats (bare `mod(...)`) | itself | ~nothing — see the buff-bot rule below |
| `PlayerModifier` | you | usually **worthless**: "5% MORE physical damage" or impale effect buffs *your* hits, and your minions deal the damage. Only defensive/utility ones count (turtle's PDR, flask effect) |
| `MinionModifier` | your minions | **the jackpot** — but read the tag gate |
| `AllyModifier` | you **and** your minions (`CalcPerform.lua:2194` inserts into both lists) | jackpot, ungated |

**Buff-bot rule: a spectre's own damage is usually irrelevant, so buy the aura, not the monster.** Measured:
the Hulking Miscreation contributed **5,846 DPS of its own — 0.27%** of the build's total, while its buff was
worth **+43.6%**. This inverts the intuition that you want a "strong" spectre.

**Corpse tier is not a quality axis — diff the three tiers, because the premium can be nothing or
everything.** Two measured cases, same league, opposite answers:
- **Hulking Miscreation**: normal and *Perfect* grant **verbatim identical** minion buffs at the same life
  multiplier; Perfect only improves the spectre's *own* attack damage (5% → 8% per 450 armour) — 0.27% of
  your DPS. **Buy the normal tier** (~20c vs Perfect's ~1 div). ⚠ `Imperfect` grants no minion buff at all.
- **Forest Tiger**: all three tiers are identical in stats *and* mods — but **only `Perfect` carries the
  extra skill `AzmeriTigerHaste`**, "an aura that increases movement speed, attack speed and cast speed of
  you and your allies". ⚠ *Not* the whole story: normal **and** Perfect also carry
  `chance_to_grant_frenzy_charge_to_nearby_allies_on_hit_% = 5` — present in `Spectres.lua` as a **bare
  comment with no `mod()` call**, i.e. a real game stat PoB **does not model**. So a PoB measurement of
  either tier is a floor, and only `Imperfect` is genuinely inert.

So the rule is mechanical, not economic: **diff `skills:` AND `grants:` across all three tiers in the lake
before paying for "Perfect"** — the difference may be a rounding error or the whole reason to buy.

**Tag gates decide everything — check YOUR minions' tags, not the spectre's.** `MonsterTag` conditions are
matched case-insensitively against the *receiving* minion's `monsterTags` in `Data/Minions.lua`. Worked
example: the Miscreation's +100% damage / +30% speed is gated to `Construct`; **SRS are tagged `construct`,
`skeleton` and `undead` simultaneously**, so they take it — as does a Carrion Golem (`construct`) — while
Raise Zombie (`undead` only) gets nothing. The same tag system is why the Judgemental Spirit's
`Skeleton`-tagged damage grant lands on SRS. A spectre can therefore be build-defining for one minion type
and literally zero for another; there is no general ranking.

**"Increased" dilutes; expect far less than the printed number.** +100% *increased* minion damage is
additive with every other increase you own (supports, tree, jewels), so it lands in a large existing pool:
the measured result was **+43.6%**, not +100%. Judge `MORE` multipliers and flat added damage on different
terms — and prefer measurement to arithmetic, since minion increase pools are hard to enumerate.
⚠ **Dilution is not exclusion — say "adds into the same pool", never "doesn't stack".** Separate speed
buffs (Onslaught, a Haste aura, an action-speed buff) all apply simultaneously; only their *increased*
components add rather than multiply. Measured proof: a Haste-granting spectre still returned **+11.8%** on a
build already running Onslaught. Action speed is the exception that genuinely sidesteps the pool — it is a
separate multiplier, not an increase.

**Enablers can be worth more than damage.** A spectre granting a *capability* can free a support gem, which
is worth the whole gem's slot. Worked example (◐ untested in game): Perfect Serpent Warrior grants allies
`Condition:CanWither`, the same flag "chance to inflict Withered on Hit" sets — potentially freeing a
Withering Touch support. Simmed on a wither-dependent build: swapping that support for Multistrike was
**+39%** *if* wither is still sustained, **−25%** if it is not. ⚠ PoB cannot resolve this: its withered-stack
config is an **enemy-state assertion** applied whether or not any source exists, so it will happily show the
upside of a swap that silently removes your only wither. Measure both ends before betting.

### 3e-4. Animate Guardian — a wearable ally-aura, and PoB's third blind spot

The AG is best understood as **a minion you dress in ally-buff uniques**, and the meta kits are two-handed —
so "what shield for my AG" usually answers itself: **none**.

| Weapon path | Grants the party | Cost class |
|---|---|---|
| **Dying Breath** (staff) | 18% increased damage to allies + 18% curse effect on nearby enemies | ~10c |
| **Kingmaker** (2h axe) | ⭐ ***+10 Fortification* to nearby allies** (≈10% less hit damage taken for the PLAYER) + culling + rarity | tens of div |

Classic kit around it: **Leer Cast** (⭐ current variant = **50%** ally damage — buffed in 3.19; pre-3.19
memory says 15%) · body/boots for AG survival (Zahndethus, Gruthkul, Doppelgänger) · and the sleeper tech:
**corruption-implicit gloves** — e.g. `Curse Enemies with Despair on Hit` makes the AG a walking **−15%
chaos res** debuff (× any curse-effect amplification), which on a chaos/poison build is a damage multiplier
wearing a glove slot. ✅ Measured on a live build: a Dying Breath + Leer Cast + Despair-implicit AG =
**+38.3% Full DPS**. ⚠ AG gear is **destroyed if the AG dies** — budget accordingly, give it Minion Life +
Meat Shield, and feed it the expensive axe only after its survival is proven in your actual content.

⚠⚠ **PoB cannot model ANY of this natively** — verified in source (`CalcActiveSkill.lua`: minion item sets
supply *weapon data only*; item mods from minion gear are applied to no one). This is the **third class of
invisible ally power** after unmodeled-spectre buffs (§3e-1) and skill-list auras (§3e). Workaround: a
**labeled CustomModifierBlock** stating the ally-buff lines explicitly (`Minions deal N% increased Damage`,
`Nearby Enemies have -X% to Chaos Resistance`), with its assumptions (AG alive + nearby, curse uptime)
written in the title so the block is toggleable and honest. The standing rule, three instances strong:
**PoB models none of the buffs your minions grant unless forced to, and each grant class needs its own
workaround.**

### 3f. Auras & reservation
Typical: Anger+Generosity, Skitterbots, Purity of Elements, **Envy via United in Dream** (✅ measured ~87%
of a poison build's damage — dropping it is a build-defining decision, not a tweak). ⚠ Reservation maxes
out fast; ✅ reservation efficiency essentially **cannot roll on rings** (only a corrupted Anger implicit) —
it lives on helmet/body (Essence of Loathing ✅ `essences.txt`) and influenced amulets.

### 3g. Defense chassis notes (✅ hard-won)
- **Block engine** (✅ live): Bone Offering + Rumi's + Tempest Shield + `As The Mountain` **as an anoint** →
  66/78. Auto-generated endurance charges via **Enduring Composure** small cluster (✅ worth 9,553 EHP; PoB
  needs `useEnduranceCharges` set to count it).
- ⛔ **Glancing Blows without an on-block payoff** — ✅ simmed −1,307 EHP (blocked hits deal 65%; 2X×0.35 <
  X). It's the keystone most summoner-block advice assumes. Needs Aegis-style recovery to be worth it.
- ⛔ **MoM + Eldritch Battery on a summoner** — ✅ removed after repeated failure: mana lost to hits = unable
  to summon. **PoB scores MoM as top EHP and is structurally blind to this.**
- ⛔ % increased armour on an ES chest (tiny base); flat armour (Granite flask) is the only armour lever.
- ✅ Hit-fed sustain beats kill-fed: `Flagellant's` flasks / Enduring Composure stay up in the lone-rare and
  boss fights that starve kill-fed charges.

### 3i. Cross-build TECH (→ [`_concepts/`](../concepts/README.md) — the tech database)
Techs are archetype-independent — record them once in `_concepts/` (with **aliases** and **references**)
and link from here. First entry, ✅ realized in-game: **[fire→chaos conversion](../concepts/minion-fire-to-chaos.md)**
(Anger+Generosity flat fire + `Minions convert 100% of Fire Damage to Chaos Damage` gloves → everything
exits as poison-scaling chaos; ✅ **+19.8% measured**; same tech powers skeleton-mage and zoomancer
chaos variants). Trigger-wand offering automation (§3c) is the next candidate to get its own entry.

### 3h. Cluster jewels (✅ mechanics verified)
Minion-damage Large (8-11 passives) → **sockets accept own size or smaller**, chain **Large → Medium →
Small** (max 3 deep). Smalls with `Added Small Passive Skills grant:` enchants are point-efficient (✅
measured ~29-38k DPS/pt on a live build). Full smalls pool: `text_lake/clusters.txt`. Key notables to
watch: ◐ Renewal, Feasting Fiends, Vicious Bite, Blessed Rebirth; ✅ Enduring Composure (defense).

## 4. Staged acquisitions (generic minion spine)

| Stage | Get | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **A1 (lvl 1-12)** | SRS from **Breaking Some Eggs**; ◐ Sidhebreath amulet; +1 minion wand (vendor recipe: magic wand + Ghastly Eye + Orb of Alteration) | ✅ quest timing banked in `reference_data/quest_gem_rewards.md` |
| **A2-A3 (12-38)** | Bandit: usually Kill All; ◐ Praxis (mana), Bones of Ullr (✅ used), Reverberation Rod (+2 socketed, Spell Echo), Tabula; Siosa (A3) backfills gems | ✅/◐ |
| **A4 (38+)** | **Unleash from Eternal Nightmare** (✅ NOT at Siosa); Normal Lab | ✅ |
| **Campaign tail (55-68)** | Cruel/Merciless Lab; +2 minion helm tier; re-cap res after BOTH Kitava hits (−30% each) | ✅ |
| **Maps entry (68-75)** | Uber Lab; 5L→6L; Darkness Enthroned + 2 good Ghastly Eyes; archetype-defining unique (✅ e.g. United in Dream was 16c at league week 1 — fork-deciders are cheap early) | ✅ |
| **Mid maps (75-90)** | Cluster jewel package; anoint (✅ can carry a 9-pt notable like As The Mountain for one oil set); ◐ The Dark Monarch (spectre/golem count), Soulwrest, Alberon's (str-stack skeletons); The Covenant for poison variants (✅) | ✅/◐ |
| **Endgame (90+)** | ◐ Arakaali's Fang + The Squire (poison chase); ◐ Doryani's Prototype (lightning spectres); awakened supports; AG chase gear | ◐ |

---

## 5. Known traps (all ✅ verified, all cost someone real currency or a death)

1. ⛔ **The Dark Monarch is Wraithlord-class** — ✅ every one of its 16 variants pairs *"Maximum number of
   X is Doubled"* with **"Cannot have Minions other than X"** (`uniques.txt`). Survey advice calls it
   "mandatory for spectre/golem setups" without the exclusivity — it is **mono-minion only** and deletes a
   mixed army (zoo, our block SRS, anything with an AG + zombies). Fine for golem-shells and pure spectres.
2. ⛔ **Wraithlord** — "+1 spectre per socketed Ghastly Eye" *but* "You cannot have Non-Spectre Minions" —
   deletes SRS/zombies/AG on mixed builds.
3. ⛔ **Vis Mortis +1 spectre is legacy-only** (`{variant:1,2}`) — the current item doesn't grant it.
4. ⛔ Veiled `+1 Spectre` prefix is Catarina-only; **not benchable** onto owned gear.
5. ⚠ **PoB group-count conflation**: a socket group holding Raise Spectre *and* Animate Guardian can't have
   its count set without multiplying the AG too — spectre DPS reads low or AG reads absurd.
6. ⚠ **Every import resets**: Full-DPS flags, group counts, pantheon, bandit, charge toggles. Checklist
   before trusting any post-import number.
7. ⚠ Minion stats are invisible: minion life/res in no readout; minion-mod items read "unchanged" in
   import diffs; zombie/golem groups excluded from Full DPS. Judge minion survivability in-game.
8. ⚠ **"In the game data ≠ obtainable"** — gate every find: spawn weight (read *which key* the zero is
   under) → variant → slot legality → market. See `playbooks/gear-shopping.md` pitfall.

## 6. Survey ledger

### 2026-08-04 — initial roster + infrastructure discovery (3 queries, Google AI Mode)
- Queries: "best minion summoner builds 3.29 all archetypes" · "minion build essential uniques leveling to

  / r/PathOfExileSSF threads (3.29-current).
- **Poison-minion consensus**: pRAW S-tier > poison SRS A-tier (safest starter) > HoAg B-tier (niche tank);
  "Spiders" (Arakaali's Fang) also in the conversation. Core poison gear consensus matches our verified
  stack (The Covenant + United in Dream/Severed in Sleep).
- **Existence-gated** against the text lake: ✅ Congregation Support, Dark Monarch, Soulwrest, Sidhebreath,
  Arakaali's Fang, Guardian Turtle, and ✅ **Bladefall of Trarthus** (pRAW's setup skill — survey garbled it
  as "of the Tarter"; user caught it, and our own `praw-necromancer/` entry already documents the real gem).
  ⚠ **Gate lesson (2026-08-04): an exact-string miss is NOT proof of nonexistence — fuzzy-grep the base name
  ("bladefall") before ruling a name a synthesis artifact.** AI-synthesized sources garble proper nouns
  routinely; the first verdict here was a false ⛔.
- **Known-wrong claims caught**: "United in Dream grants Unholy Might" (✅ our owned copy granted **Envy**
  L25 + 60% poison chance + minion chaos res); "SRS last ~30 seconds" (base is 5s); "Unnatural Strength =
  100% phys-to-chaos conversion" (it's +2 minion gem levels) — cross-version/synthesis blending, standard
  for this source.
- One query-2 source was **r/pathofexile2builds (PoE2)** and another was a 2019 compendium — leveling-staple
  claims are old-but-stable items, kept at ◐.

### 2026-08-04 (later) — directed searches: skeleton mages + zoomancer
- Both "absent" archetypes are alive (rostered above with aliases). Key freshness catch: **skeleton mages no
  longer need Dead Reckoning** (transfigured gem does it natively) — older guides mislead here.
- **Chaos Poison Zoomancer** confirmed as a dominant 3.29 minion variant, built on the exact core our live
  character already owns (The Covenant + Ghastly Eyes + poison scaling) — a zoo pivot would be cheap.
- ✅ **Tech-db validated in the field the same day:** the fire→chaos glove tech (`_concepts/minion-fire-to-chaos.md`,
  banked as an IDEA on 2026-07-19 from a friend's concept) was equipped on the live character (+19.8% measured),
  AND surfaced independently in both directed surveys as the chaos-variant enabler for skeleton mages and
  zoomancer. One tech, three archetypes — the reason _concepts/ is cross-style.

### 2026-08-04 (later still) — verification queue worked
- ✅ **Congregation Support**: Exceptional support, req 72, **30-64% MORE max minions** (lvl 1→15), quality =
  minion MS. Verified via `get_gem_detail`. Big enough to sim on any max-count build.
- ✅ **Dark Monarch**: full mechanics from `uniques.txt` — promoted to trap #1 (mono-minion exclusivity the
  surveys omitted).
- ⛔ **"3.29 AG gear-inspection UI"**: refuted by the league doc's dedicated patch-note string checks.
- ◐ **Golem armies**: rostered — pure golemancer B-tier; the live form is the S-tier *buff-shell* (golems
  scale the player). One garbled league name in the response ("Curse of the Old Flame") — standard synthesis
  noise, ignored.

### Verification queue
- [ ] Gladiator Holy Relic variant — digest a guide (`guide-analysis`) before crediting
- [ ] Popcorn SRS + Soulwrest + Chains of Command — candidate `guide-analysis` targets to fill roster gaps
- [x] Congregation Support price: ✅ **~9 div minimum on trade** (user-checked 2026-08-04) — Exceptional gems
  are chase-tier, consistent with the Pact gems' class. ✅ Drop source (user, from item info): **Incarnation of Dread or Uber Dread** — the Incarnations are the 3.27 pinnacle bosses (league doc: 'new chase-drop sources'). Drop RATE ◐ unknown. Still open: the sim on the live character's SRS 6L (sim BEFORE grinding)
- [ ] "Minions as player-buffs" (Primordial Bond golem shell) — write the `_concepts/` entry

### 3e-3. Survey ledger — buff spectres (2026-08-09)

**Query:** "PoE 3.29 best buff spectres for minion builds — which cast auras or buff your other minions"
(Google AI Mode). Run *after* building the data-derived roster, specifically to find what the data can't say.
Verdict: **the survey caught two real gaps; the data caught three survey errors.** Neither source was
sufficient alone — which is the argument for always running both.

**Survey found what data could not:**
- ✅ **Forest Tiger grants frenzy charges to nearby allies.** Real — `Spectres.lua` carries
  `chance_to_grant_frenzy_charge_to_nearby_allies_on_hit_% = 5` as a **comment with no `mod()`**, so PoB
  neither models nor exposes it. Any PoB number for this spectre is a floor. **This is the one channel no
  local sweep can reach**, and the reason to survey at all.
- ✅ **Carnage Chieftain** (`MassFrenzy` → frenzy charges) and **Host Chieftain** (`MassPower` → power
  charges) — real, in the lake, and missed by both the mod sweep *and* the aura sweep because their grants
  are non-aura skills. Free/wild, so they are the budget answer to charge generation.

**Data refuted the survey:**
- ⛔ "Forest Tiger casts a Level 20 **Precision** aura" — it casts **Haste**. Precision belongs to the
  **Naval Officer**. Classic AI blend of two real entries.
- ✅ "**Spectral Leader** grants an Action Speed multiplier" — **the survey was right and the data-based
  refutation was wrong.** It was marked ⛔ on the grounds that no such spectre appears in the 268 rows; the
  user produced [the poewiki page](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Spectral_Leader). It is a real, raisable
  undead in Sanctuary / Citadel / Fortress / Abomination / Ziggurat maps that **summons Raging Spirits and
  casts an action-speed buff on nearby allies** (8s duration, 10s cooldown, ~30m radius).
  **⚠⚠ The lesson is bigger than the entry: PoB's spectre list is a CURATED SUBSET, not the game's roster.**
  `Spectres.lua` has zero matches for it, and not one of the 268 grants ActionSpeed at all. So "not in the
  text lake" proves nothing about the game — it proves the spectre is unmodelled, which also means
  **unsimmable**. Check poewiki (`fetch_wiki_page` / `wiki_cargo_query`) before writing any spectre off.
- ⛔ "Perfect Pain Artist grants **Celerity**" — it casts **Zealotry** and grants `AllyModifier` crit
  multiplier. No "Celerity" exists in the data.

**Confirmed by both:** Guardian Turtle (Determination + PDR), Forest Warrior (Onslaught to allies + cull),
Spirit of Fortune (Wrath + lucky lightning).

**Method note:** the survey named `sources: []` while citing Reddit and a dated GhazzyTV video inline — see
`frameworks/README.md`, an empty source array is not evidence of synthesis.
